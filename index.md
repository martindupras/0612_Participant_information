# Dupras Pilot Study \- Participant Information 

**Study Title:**   
*Technology Probes Study on Programming by playing*  
Conducted by Martin Dupras, Open University PGR researcher

**Contact details:**  
[martin.dupras@open.ac.uk](mailto:martin.dupras@open.ac.uk) (researcher)   
[simon.holland@open.ac.uk](mailto:simon.holland@open.ac.uk) (supervisor)

**Dates**  
The study will run from the 9th of December 2024 until the 31st of January 2025\.

**Invitation to participate**  
You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide whether or not to take part, it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully.

Your participation in the study will consist of the following:

- Answering a short questionnaire  
- Downloading some PureData patches (henceforth called “the probes”) and running them on your computer (you will need to have PureData 0.54 or later installed, and audio interface, and an electric guitar)  
- realising a guided task using the probes, which should take between 30 and 90 minutes   
- Recording an audio “journal” or commentary at the start, during, and at the end of the task, which you will send to me at the end  
- Attending a short (30 minute) (online) video-call  interview at the end, which will be recorded  
- Signing a consent form authorising me to use these materials for the study

**Purpose of the Study:**  
My research is focused on finding out how we can program computers using guitar playing as the interface.  
This study aims to explore your impressions and experience of using specific prototype tools which would be useful for programming computers by playing. The “probes” that will be provided to you are simplified and specific prototypes of ways to do programming actions by playing an instrument. Your participation will allow me to understand how they can be used by different players.

**The recordings (your audio journals and the recording of the interviews will be transcribedand the transcription will be redacted to remove any identifying data**.   
The original recordings will not be used in the study and will be deleted once the transcription is complete. The data and subsequent analysis will be used to support my PhD dissertation, conference papers and journal papers.

**What will I be asked to do if I agree to participate?**  
If you consent to participate, you will be asked to do the following:

- Read all the participant information  
- Sign and return a consent form  
- Download the materials needed for the study (the “probes”)  
- Install PureData on your computer (if not already installed)  
- Over a period of three weeks, realise three guided tasks using the probes, which recording your voice (this can be on your phone, handheld recorder; any means that allows you to send me the file afterward.)

**How will the data I provide be used?**  
The data is collected exclusively for use in my PhD research.

The questionnaire is anonymous and contains no information that could identify you.  All recordings will be transcribed and anonymised. Those recordings will be stored on secure cloud storage (OneDrive) and backed up on physical media kept under lock and key at my home office. The recordings will be deleted once transcription is complete. 

Your personal information (such as your name and email address) will be kept in a secure document only accessible by me, and kept for the purpose of being able to identify your contribution if you decide to exit the study. This personal information register will be delete once I have completed my PhD degree (September 2027.)

The recordings have been approved by the Open University’s Information Governance Liaison Officer and entered into the Information Asset Register as item **28-05-033**. The recordings will not be shared with anyone and will be destroyed after transcription.) 

**Potential risks and benefits**:  
No risks have been found for this study. 

**Confidentiality**:   
Personally identifiable information will only be collected during the recorded aspects of the study and will be anonymised and deidentified before using for analysis. The information from the recording and any information you choose to provide through the questionnaires in this study will not be connected back to you. Results from this study may be published or presented at research conferences, and both the anonymously collected and anonymised data may be shared with other researchers through the Open University ORDO repository, which can be accessed at https://ordo.open.ac.uk/.

You may request a copy of the anonymised data and analysis by emailing me at the address in the “contact details” section above.

**Your right to withdraw from the study:**  
You have the right to withdraw from the study at any time during your participation by emailing me at [martin.dupras@open.ac.uk](mailto:martin.dupras@open.ac.uk).

You have the right to ask for your data to be removed after your participation in the study by emailing me at [martin.dupras@open.ac.uk](mailto:martin.dupras@open.ac.uk), up until the time all data have been aggregated for analysis, which will be 30th June 2025\.

**Data protection:**

The Open University is the Data Controller for the personal data that you provide.  
The lawful reason for processing your data will be that conducting academic research is part of The Open University’s public task. (The consent we request from you relates to ethical considerations)  
The audio recording exists only on a standalone audio recorder in the researcher’s possession. No one else has access to it. The recording will be erased securely once transcription (audio-to-text) has been completed.

You have rights as a data subject:  
\-   To request a copy of the personal data we have about you  
\-   To rectify any personal data which is inaccurate or incomplete  
\-   To restrict the processing of your data  
\-   To receive a copy of your data in an easily transferrable format (if relevant)  
\-   To erase your data  
\-   To object to us processing your data  
If you are concerned about the way we have processed your personal information, you can contact the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). Please visit the ICO’s website for further details.
